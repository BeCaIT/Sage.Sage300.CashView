You must still make the following changes manually (within the VB IDE):
* FIRST, rename the UserControl to AccpacSC9100UICtrl, then save the project group.
* NEXT, remove the following menu items:
    - mnuFile_Import
    - popmnuFile_Import
    - mnuFile_Export
    - popmnuFile_Export
    - mnuFile_s3
    - popmnuFile_s3
  then save the project group AGAIN.
* Create and build the UI-specific resource DLL using the sample RC files and makefile as a basis (see ACCPACUIGlobals.bas for details).

When editing the UserControl's code, most of the code you'll write will be in the "Commonly Modified Methods" sections.  Commented instructions are found in the code.

Start by focusing on these methods:
 * ActivateDataSources, DeactivateDataSources
 * CheckAccessRights, ResetAccessRights
 * InitAppCtlsCallout
